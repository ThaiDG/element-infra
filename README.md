# Element Infrastructure Project

## âœ¨ How to Use

Open PowerShell, change directory to `homeserver` and run:

```shell
make init # The command below will always automatically run this command first, so, you don't need to manually run it.
make select-workspace # Optional - This will also trigger the make init. You don't need to run this command manually.
make plan ENV=[dev,staging,prod] # This command will run the make select-workspace first, you can skip the ENV to use the default demo ENV
make apply AUTOAPPROVE ENV=[dev,staging,prod] # This command will run the make select-workspace first, you can skip the ENV to use the default demo ENV
make destroy AUTOAPPROVE ENV=[dev,staging,prod] # This command will run the make select-workspace first, you can skip the ENV to use the default demo ENV
```

### Window user note

If you don't want to specific the OS for every make command then follow the below steps:

- Run the command: `$PROFILE` to get the current shell profile

- Open the profile and add the below content:

    ```powershell
    $env:OS = "windows"
    Write-Host "Default OS set to $env:OS"
    ```

- Save file and reload the terminal.

- Otherwise you can run make file by: `make init OS=windows`
