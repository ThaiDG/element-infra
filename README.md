# Element Infrastructure Project

## âœ¨ How to Use

Open PowerShell, change directory to `homeserver` and run:

```shell
make init # The command below will always automatically run this command first, so, you don't need to manually run it.
make select-workspace # Optional - This will also trigger the make init. You don't need to run this command manually.
make plan ENV=[dev,staging,prod] # This command will run the make select-workspace first, you can skip the ENV to use the default dev ENV
make apply AUTOAPPROVE=true ENV=[dev,staging,prod] # This command will run the make select-workspace first, you can skip the ENV to use the default dev ENV
make destroy AUTOAPPROVE=true ENV=[dev,staging,prod] # This command will run the make select-workspace first, you can skip the ENV to use the default dev ENV
```

### Window user note

If you don't want to specific the OS for every make command then follow the below steps:

- Run the command: `$PROFILE` to get the current shell profile

- Open the profile and add the below content:

    ```powershell
    $env:OS = "windows"
    Write-Host "Default OS set to $env:OS"
    ```

- Save file and reload the terminal.

- Otherwise you can run make file by: `make init OS=windows`

- Change in scripts folder which will only being executed at the initial stage of the instance therefore we must to run the refresh command: `aws autoscaling start-instance-refresh --auto-scaling-group-name change-affected-asg --region ap-southeast-1` to apply the change after running the Terraform apply command.
- How to access the server:
  1. Go to the AWS Console and search for `EC2` service.
  2. In the navigator pannel select the `Instances`.
  3. Looking for the instance with the appropriate name to conencting to. E.g. `dev-sygnal-service`.

  5. In the instance detail page, click on Connect button at the top right conner.

  7. Move to the /app path to start working
  8. Guide for docker compose command:
      - Check whether the instance is healthy: `docker compose ps`
