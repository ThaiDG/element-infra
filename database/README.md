# Relase note

## Future improvement

- With the minimum workload, the Aurora Proxy will be costly, but not necessarily so. We will temporarily turn it off. In the future, if our users increase significantly, that would increase the workload on the database. Remember to turn on the Proxy for better ability to pool connections.
